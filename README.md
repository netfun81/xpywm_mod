# xpywm_mod

This is xpywm a Window Manager for the X window system, written in python by Hiroyuki Ohsaki
found here: https://pypi.org/project/xpywm/

I have made some modifications to the source code, mainly with cursor positioning, titlebar gap, auto layout sizes, and
using Mod4 for moving and resizing windows. 

Also I have included my .xpywmrc to make it easier to configure hotkeys rather than editing the source code.  
Just copy it to your /home/user/ folder to use.
