# xpywm_mod

This is xpywm written in python by Hiroyuki Ohsaki, found here: https://pypi.org/project/xpywm/

I have made some modifications to the source code, mainly with cursor positioning, titlebar gap, auto layout sizes, and
using Mod4 for moving and resizing windows. 

Also I have included my .xpywmrc to make it easier to configure rather than editing the source code for hotkey changes.
